    "#### Suggestion\n",
    "Before starting your homework, you may want to consider making a copy of the problem statement.  For example, you can copy `hw1.ipynb` to `hw1_working.ipynb` and then do all of your work in `hw1_working.ipynb`.  When you're ready to submit, make another copy (maybe call it `hw1_final_Group#.ipynb` where # is replaced with your group number) and make sure it runs.  Following these steps will help minimize mistakes.\n",

The data set covers taxi pickups recorded during different days in Jan 2015 (randomly sampled across days and time of that day).\n",

To include an intercept term in the regression model, you will need to append a column of $1$s to the array of predictors using the `sm.add_constant` method. The `fit` method returns a `results` instance. Use the  `results.summary` method to obtain a summary of the regression fit, the `results.params` attribute to get the estimated regression parameters, and the `conf_int` method to compute confidence intervals for the estimated parameters.
